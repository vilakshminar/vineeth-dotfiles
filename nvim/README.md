# NVIM Configuration

This directory contains configuration required to setup nvim in your local machine.<br>
This has been copied from a Macbook Pro and thus hasn't been tested on a Linux laptop.

Note that both the `.local` & `.config` directory need to be placed in your home directory.<br>
In order for neovim to load up your color schemes, create a directory inside `.config` called
`colors` and place the color scheme in that directory.<br>
Instructions for the above can be found in the init.vim script.
