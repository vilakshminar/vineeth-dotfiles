# NeoVim Configuration

This directory contains configuration required to setup neovim in your local machine.<br>
This has been tested on a Macbook Pro and hasn't been tested on a Linux machine.

Note that both the `.local` & `.config` directory need to be placed in your home directory.<br>
In order for neovim to load up your color schemes, create a directory inside `.config` called
`colors` and place the color scheme in that directory.<br>
Instructions for the above can be found in the init.vim script.
